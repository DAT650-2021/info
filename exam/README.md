## Curriculum

* All [Slides](../slides) 
* The [script](../script.pdf).
* Videos and whiteboards from [material](../lecture_material.md)
* The Solidity security [chapter](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/09smart-contracts-security.asciidoc) from Mastering Ethereum.
* Other documents linked in the script, or provided as [resources](../resources.md) are not required but may be useful for understanding.

## Connecting

Make sure you are available on teams and connected with a good internet connection, when starting the exam.
You will have to use video.
If you have connection trouble during the exam, we cannot give you additional time.

## Procedure

We reserved 20 minutes for each exam.
We have prepared several, unique questions for each exam.
We will typically ask open questions, e.g. 
* How does ... work? 
* What is the advantage of this technique? 
* What are problems with this technique?
Following up on that general question, we may ask you for specific aspects.
We may also ask you do give an example or sketch something, so it is usefull, if you have pen and paper ready and you can hold these into the camera.

## A note on oral examination and how to get a good grade

When grading an oral exam, we do not only evaluate if your answers were correct or wrong, but also how you presented your answers. 
Asked about a technique, you should be able to present it including most relevant aspects.
You can easily rehearse that, by taking any section or chapter from the script, making sure you can present a short summary.

## Shedule

Exam takes place Monday 13. December.
