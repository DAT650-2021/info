## Project topics

Project topics are available at [project.md](project.md).

If you want to do a different project, please talk to us.

## Groups

The project should be done in groups of 2.
By September 28th please tell Arian by email who is in your group and what project you plan to work on.

If you have good reasons to work alone, talk to us about that.

## Presentation
All groups are expected to present their project to the class on Tuesday 12th October.
This will happen on zoom.
The goal for the presentation is not to create a competition, but rather to learn from each other.

## Collaboration
Each group needs to write their own code and report. However, talking to each other is of cause encouraged.

## Report
You need to hand in a report for your project. 
Code should be published on github.
The report should explain some background and show and explain your results.
You can also explain what you may add to your project, if you had more time.
The report should not exceed 10 pages latex article.
Alternative you could also hand in a jupyther notebook.

## Grading
The project will be graded based on the report.
Grading criteria are:
* Show understanding in the report.
* Extend of simulation.

While no simulation leaves nothing to explain, it is more important that you show that you understand results and assumptions you achieve, than that you have extensive simulations.
