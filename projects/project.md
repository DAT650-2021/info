# Project

In this project, you should choose one of the subjects below and create a Jupyter Notebook similar to those used during the lectures. This Notebook should contain different stubs for modelling the subject that you chose, experiments, charts, and notes. Note that the Notebook you deliver is considered as the report for the project, so it should contain enough explanations and analysis to show
* How you modelled different parts of the project
* What limitations and abstractions your model has
* What experiments you have done 
* The results of your experiments (preferably with charts and tables)
* Explanations on your results

You can use lecture notebooks as a starting point. 


## Project 1: Selfish and Stubborn Mining
The goal of this project is to model selfish mining in Bitcoin. In this project, you are expected to:
* Model a way to show miners network power. 
* Verity theoretical boundaries through repeated and long experiments.
* Have several selfish miners instead of only one.
* Model Stubborn Mining
* Model selfish mining with the GHOST protocol.

Try to answer the following questions with your experiments:

1-  What is the effect of network power on selfish mining? 

2-  In which scenario is the attack more profitable, all miners having the same network power near half of the attacker, or one miner with higher network power than the attacker, but other miners with negligible network power?

3-  What is the effect of having several selfish miners? 

4-  What is the impact of GHOST on selfish mining? Can you find a good approach for selfish mining with GHOST? 

5-  What is the impact of stubborn mining on selfish mining? 



## Project 2: Uncles and Uncles Rewards
The goal of this project is to model uncles and uncles' rewards. In this project, you are expected to:
* Model a blockchain that uses uncles and uncle rewards. 
* Model rewarding mechanism to reward uncle block creators. 
* Model selfish mining (only one attacker) in this blockchain. 

Try to answer the following questions with your experiments:

1-  How do uncles improve the fairness of the blockchain? For this, you should compare the outcome of miners with and without uncles.

2-  What is the impact of uncles on selfish mining? Is selfish mining more profitable with uncles?

3-  What does it mean in this model for the selfish mining attack to be profitable?


## Project 3: Bitcoin NG
The goal of this project is to model Bitcoin NG. In this project, you are expected to:
* Model keyblocks and microblocks. 
* Model forks. 
* Model reward mechanism and incentives. 
* Verify that wrong reward distribution allows attacks.

Try to answer the following questions with your experiments:

1-  What is the impact of microblocks and keyblocks on the throughput compared to the Bitcoin blockchain?

2-  Do slow keyblocks lead to less forks?

3-  What does it mean in this model for the selfish mining attack to be profitable?
